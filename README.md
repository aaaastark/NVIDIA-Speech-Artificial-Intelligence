# NVIDIA Speech Artificial Intelligence.
### [Speech AI Summit](https://www.linkedin.com/events/speechaisummit6980590151840264192/). On November 2nd and 3rd day was healed the "online conversations" with experts from Google, Meta, NVIDIA, and more on trends and techniques in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies. I participated as a volunteer (Data Scientist & AI - ML Engineer) audience person.
